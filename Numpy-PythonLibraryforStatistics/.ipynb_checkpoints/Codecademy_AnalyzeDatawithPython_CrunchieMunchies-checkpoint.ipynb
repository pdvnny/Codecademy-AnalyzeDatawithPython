    "The goal was to determine how \"CrunchieMunchies\" at 60 calories (per serving - I assume but info was not provided) compares to the calorie counts of other cereals. CrunchieMunchies's (CM's) calorie count is lower than the median and mean, and comfortably in the lower half of all cereal calorie counts based on the median and mean alone. The percentile/percentage information provides the best comparison for \"how low\" the CM calorie count is; few cereals (only 3 of 77 cereals in this dataset) had lower counts, meaning CM is a healthy option with regard to calorie count. Within the scope of the task and information provided, CM can be considered a healthy cereal."
