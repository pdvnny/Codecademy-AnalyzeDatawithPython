# Codecademy - Data Scientist - Analyzing Data with Python

 Projects and assignments that I completed while learning how to analyze data with Python on Codecademy.
 
 This repo focuses on project using *__NumPy, Pandas, matplotlib__*.

# What this repo is...

I practice coding in Python on Codecademy whenever I have free time. A lot of my work at Boston University is in C++, so it has been helpful to keep practicing Python via Codecademy at the same time. The work in this repo is projects that I completed as part of the lessons on that site.

The specific topics of each file are identified at the top of the script (for the most part).

### Outline of Topics in each directory
* *will update eventually*

# Opening work in this repo

For the most part, everything in this repo was completed in Jupyter Notebooks. Any environment that can open Jupyter Notebooks should not have trouble opening and running these files.

You will definitly need at least NumPy, Pandas, and matplotlib available to run these scripts.
